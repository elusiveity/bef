So returning readers will probably be wondering what the hell I've done. New people will not really understand what's going on.

I'm going to TL;DR this, because I have to run out for dinner in a sec & Im on holidays:
- I dumped Wordpress for my blog after it was hacked, I'm using Jekyll now
- Newsletter doesn't work; I'll do it one day but not today. Infact the mailing list exists so just email me to get added
- The newsgroup is still invite only. I haven't vetted any new candidates but let me know if you're interested. It's tech/nerd related and a little old school
- This is all run through github pages
- Eating vegan is super hard
- My iPad just died for no bloody reason. Don't expect any of my cartoons to get drawn.

Content will be uploaded as I can do it. I have something like 100 articles to go through in Evernote, so I'll have to hold off until I'm in a [whiskey induced coding frenzy](https://xkcd.com/323/).
