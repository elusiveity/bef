This will probably present itself as an unpopular opinion, however I'm not going to have my comment lost in a Yahoo reaction.

# FBI arrested shady-business-designed mobile phones

So what's happened? The FBI has caught a CEO red-handed knowingly providing encrypted devices to drug traffickers. Undercover agents ran a sting operation to get some dude called Vincent Ramos on record stating that his phones are specifically designed for illegal shit.

What most likely happened is that the FBI used the undercover agents to pose as shady people (didnt need much acting skill for that job I bet), then sent them into a meeting with a wire, recorded old mate selling his product to them, then busted his ass in an anticlimatic ending. Ramos was caught telling undercover agents that his phones were specifically designed with drug traficking in mind, however let's have a look at what that actually means.

# Why he would have said that

He's a fucking salesman.

I could go out right now and buy 1000 condoms on Alibaba. I could then put up advertisements saying "ultra durable, lubricant-free, cylindrical silicon wraps for sale. Come rolled in convenient packaging. Multiple uses. Wholesaling rates available.
